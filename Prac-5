Github repo for [prac 5](https://github.com/aidenlignieres/TODO-List-App)

During the development, I addressed an issue related to the TODO App class in an Android application. 

The main problem with the development of the app was the incomplete stage of not being able to complete the icons/images since this was a rushed job.
Since I rushed this I was only able to complete everything else other than the images/drawables which were required for the app to function.

I didn't learn much since I rushed I only followed the steps/copied most of the steps mainly the coded part for the xml displays and the activities.
