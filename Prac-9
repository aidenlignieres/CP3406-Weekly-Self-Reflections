Github repo for [prac 9](https://github.com/aidenlignieres/CP3406-GuessTheCeleb-App/tree/Part-2)

During the development, of the GuessTheCeleb part 2, some of the aspects were quite reflective of what could have helped build my assignment app to a high standard.

While following the prac there were some steps that gave vague instructions. A problem that I had with this prac and almost every other prac was the XML pages changing 
from a normal LinearLayout to a fragment with the linearLayout inside it. During the whole time of developing the app, there were problems such as no difficulty enum or 
forgetting to ID fragments, text view, spinner, and buttons, These fixes are want took most of the time since it was a challenge to find the problem or implement a way to 
resolve the problem.

The Enum problem was resolved by making a separate class to hold it. for the other problems, it was a simple fix but renaming/adding ID to the required locations.
