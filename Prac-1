Github repo for [prac 1](https://github.com/aidenlignieres/CP3406-GuessingGame)

While learning how to operate Android Studio it gave me feelings of me using PyCharm or VSCode. When going through the prac its clear instructions while giving a brief description on what each step or task does. Going through the task gave an understanding on how most app is developed, even the most basic apps as well as how much time and effect is put in to create a functional app. During the prac having myself do some research on the Toast API allow me to understand on how it operates and how it can make apps function better. The experience that I felt during the prac was the need to quickly be refreshed on how to code java or learn a new language (Kotlin). What could of made everything easier for completing the prac would have been relearning java before the start of semester so it is freshly in my mind and either watching the pre-recorded lectures beforehand.
