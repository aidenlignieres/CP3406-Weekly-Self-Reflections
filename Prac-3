During the development, I addressed an issue related to the StopwatchActivity class in an Android application. 
The initial problem was with the settingsClicked() method, which was causing an ActivityNotFoundException when launching the SettingsActivity.

To resolve the issue, I made the following changes:

Modified the settingsClicked() method to use an ActivityResultLauncher for starting the SettingsActivity, ensuring that the activity is declared in the AndroidManifest.xml file.
Updated the onActivityResult() method to handle the result returned by the SettingsActivity.
After applying these changes, the app was able to launch the SettingsActivity successfully.

Additionally, I encountered another issue in the SettingsActivity class, specifically in the doneClicked() method, where a NumberFormatException was occurring. 
To fix this, I checked if the input string was empty before parsing it as an integer.

By making these modifications, I was able to address the issues and prevent the app from crashing.
