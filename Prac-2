While learning the use of LinearLayoutCompat as the root layout, which allowed for a vertical orientation. 
The XML file defined various UI elements, including a TextView to display the sum, and a TableLayout containing multiple TableRows. 
Each TableRow held three Buttons with different numeric values, except for the last TableRow, which contained a single Button labeled "Clear." 
The XML file utilized attributes like layout_width, layout_height, layout_weight, textSize, and onClick to specify the appearance and behavior of the UI elements.

With the extention of the AppCompatActivity class, indicating it was an activity within an Android application. 
In the onCreate method, the layout file activity_main.xml was set as the content view for the activity. 
This connection between the Java code and the XML layout allowed for the interaction between the UI and the logic.

The buttonClicked method caught my attention as it handled the click events of the Buttons defined in the XML file. 
By extracting the text of the clicked Button and converting it to an integer, the code incremented the sum variable accordingly. 
If the text was "Clear," the sum was reset to zero. The updated sum was then displayed in the TextView.
