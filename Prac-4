During the development, I addressed an issue related to the Reflex Checker App class in an Android application. 
The initial problem was with importing the required images, which was causing an ActivityNotFoundException when launching the app.

After getting the images add the other problem was the consistent changes of names for sting variables I had.

Additionally, When making the GameActivity it wasn't that hard but after a bit of time I got lost in some of the aspects like why are we dividing the seconds by 1e9 and why are we drawing so many baselines?
After a time I then understood why and that was the divide by 1e9 allows us to get the most account time to a second/millisecond while the baseline is used to display/initialize the images which I going to be used.

Understanding the requirement of having the drawable allows displaying of images upon initializing the activity on creat.
