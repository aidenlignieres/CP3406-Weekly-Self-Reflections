Github repo for [prac 6](https://github.com/aidenlignieres/CP3406-FoleyuApp)

During the development, of the Foleyuapp (FoleyApp typo on creation for app name) there were mind problems and good insights which should have been used in my second assignment.

The problem which occurred was ensuring the second activity which would be used wasn't the parent activity to allow the user to go back to the main activity by closing and re-opening the app.
the second problem was the viewbind was enabled which that took a good couple of minutes for me to find out how to fix, this affected 2 classes and 1 enum.

The downside of myself not being able to be more proactive in this subject to complete the pracs I could have implemented sound to my final assignment which could have kept the kids more entertained.
